        <h3>About</h3>
        <p> Master Swordsman: As he was a Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps, Kyojuro was one of the most powerful and skilled swordsmen in the entire organization.[23] Additionally, Kyojuro is part of the Rengoku family which has an impressive lineage of powerful swordsmen and Flame Hashira, giving Kyojuro an edge in developing and polishing his swordsmanship. His extraordinary swordsmanship skill has been displayed on multiple occasions across the series. </p>
        <p>Flame Breathing (炎ほのおの呼こ吸きゅう Honō no kokyū?): A Breathing Style taught to Kyojuro by the previous Flame Hashira, Shinjuro Rengoku, and later mastered by reading the instruction books left behind by previous Flame Hashira in the Rengoku Family.</p>
        <p>The Rengoku family has long since had a practice called "Kankagari" (觀かん篝かがり kankagari?). For the duration of their pregnancies/gestation period, every seven days the wives will spend two hours gazing at a large flaming torch. This seems to be what causes the men in the family to have flame colored hair.</p>
