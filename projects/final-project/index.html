        <h2>Quotes that spark a fire</h2>
  <p>" Life is a series of decisions. You never have unlimited options or unlimited time to think, but what you choose in that instant defines who you are"</p>
  <p>"Go ahead and live with your head held high. No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness, set your heart ablaze. Grit your teeth and look straight ahead. Even if you stop and crouch down, time won't wait for you or snuggle you and grieve along with you. Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here. As a Hashira, of course I would shield my juniors."</p>
  <p>"Growing old and dying is what gives meaning and beauty to the fleeting span of a human life. It's precisely because we age and die that our lives have value and nobility. Strength is not a word that means much in regard to the flesh."</p>
